# WebSystem

## Content Management System

The **WebSystem** was developed in 2001 with the intention of encompassing all the necessary tools at the time to create and maintain a website for Web 2.0.

At that time, there were no frameworks or tools to facilitate the development of internet applications, and there was a high demand for website creation.

### How To

1. Run command: docker-compose up -d in project directory
2. Go to the homepage of the site in http://localhost.

The access manager can be performed in:

http://localhost/admin
User: user
Password: pass
